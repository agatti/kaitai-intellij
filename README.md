## FAQ

### How do I run this?

Right now the plugin is simply not complete enough to be put on the JetBrains plugin market, so for now unless you plan
to test this or work on it, just hold on until things are ready. That said, once you can successfully build the plugin
using the instructions in the appropriate section, executing the `runIde` Gradle task should do the trick.

If that's good enough for you, you can run `gradle buildPlugin` in the plugin's root directory, and a file called
`build/libs/Kaitai-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` should have been created if everything went right. You can then manually install
the plugin by pointing the IDE to that file when importing external plugins.
